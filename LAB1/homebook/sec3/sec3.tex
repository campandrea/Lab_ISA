\section{Advanced architecture development}
\graphicspath{{sec3/images/}}
In this section is analyzed the design of the same IIR filter seen previously but with an advanced architecture, developed with the J-look-ahead technique. The basic equation of the filter is the following:
$$ y[n] = b_0x[n] + b_1x[n-1] + a_1y[n-1]$$

The J-look-ahead technique involves rewriting the equation by replacing the term $y[n-1]$ by evaluating it as a function of $y[n-2]$.
$$ y[n-1] = b_0x[n-1] + b_1x[n-2] + a_1y[n-2]$$

Then it is possible to replace the result obtained in the starting equation:
$$ y[n] = b_0x[n] + b_1x[n-1] + a_1(b_0x[n-1] + b_1x[n-2] + a_1y[n-2])$$
$$ y[n] = b_0x[n] + (b_1 + a_1)x[n-1] + a_1b_1x[n-2] + {a_1}^{2}y[n-2]$$

While keeping the classical architecture of the IIR direct form II filter, the resulting equation can be implemented through the scheme of a second-order filter.
