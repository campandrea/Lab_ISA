\subsection{Memory and Write back stage}
The last two stages involve reading and writing from memory and saving data to the register file.
The memory stage contains the data memory, which receives the data, address and signals from the previous pipe stage to execute the store and load instructions. At the output there is a mux to determine which data must be written inside the register file between the data coming out from the memory, the data coming out from the ALU or the PC.
