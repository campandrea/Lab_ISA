\subsection{Instruction Decode stage}
The decode stage contains the blocks used to generate the control and data signals from the fetched instruction. The control unit decodes the instruction and generates the control signals for the other functional units. The register file extracts the address fields from the instruction and asynchronously outputs the words associated with the addressed cells. In this stage there is also the immediate generation unit which, starting from the data in the instruction, makes the sign extension and generates the immediate data on 32 bits that can be used in the execution stage. Finally, another main block is dedicated to hazard detection for jump or load instructions.
