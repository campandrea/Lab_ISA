\subsection{Introduction}
RISC-V contains an open source Instruction Set Architecture based specifically on a limited set of operations. The specifications are not fully defined, but leave room for choice dictated by the needs of each user. In particular, the internal parallelism can vary between 32, 64 and 128 bits, the number of registers can be 16 or 32, a floating point unit can be included or not and so on. In this way, the same ISA can be used to define a general purpose processor with 64-bit parallelism, the ability to handle more complex operations and a processor dedicated to IoT solutions with low energy demand with 32-bit parallelism and minimal hardware.\\
