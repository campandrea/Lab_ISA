\subsection{Modified ISA}
The Istruction set of the implemented processor has been expanded by adding a new instruction that allows the execution of the operation \textit{absolute value}. Thanks to this instruction, during the execution stage it is possible to evaluate the module of a number using the dedicated hardware component in the ALU. Only a source register \textit{Rs1} and a destination register \textit{Rd} are required to perform the operation. In order to remain RISC-V compliant, the decision was made to exploit the I-type instruction format despite the fact that the immediate field will not be used.
Binary encoding has been adopted as follows:
\begin{description}
    \item{Opcode:} 0010011
    \item{func3:} 011
\end{description}
